hi this repo includes the unrendered quarto containing the code, the rendered quarto doc of our data translation analysis, and the slides to our presentation

i wanted to note that i will be turning in two more things separately:

a video made by someone in my group of our presentation with audio issues :(

and a link to the google slides with videos of our presentation embedded into each slide
